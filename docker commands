build a docker image

docker build -t name of image .

So now you can run any command in a running container just knowing its ID (or name):
docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> echo "Hello from container!"
docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> /bin/sh

Note that exec command works only on already running container. If the container is currently stopped, you need to first run it with the following command:

docker run -it -d shykes/pybuilder /bin/bash
The most important thing here is the -d option, which stands for detached. 
It means that the command you initially provided to the container (/bin/bash) will be run in the background and the container will not stop immediately.



Command to check container running 
docker ps 


to list all contqainer running and stop 
docker ps â€“a

to stop a running container 
docker stop [option] container_id


Run a conrtainer
docker run -it -p 5000:5000 name of iamge


Delete container or images
docker system prune -a will delete ALL unused data (i.e., in order: containers stopped, volumes without containers and images with no containers).
docker system prune without -a will remove (for images) only dangling images, or images without a tag
