       DATA
	Qualitative-->(Nominal,Ordinal)
	Quantitative--->?(Descrete,Continous)
	
	
----Qualitative--deals with chracterstics and descripter that can be measure easily,but can be observed subjectively --

Nominal Data-->Data with no inherent order or ranking  such as gender or race called Nominal data
Ordinal data-->Data with ordered series such as shown in table 
oo1--> good
002-->bad
003-->better


---QUANTITATIVE DATA-->DEALS WITH NUMBER AND THINGS THAT WE MEASURE OBJEVTIVELY 
Discrete data--finite number of possible values 
Continous Data -- infinite num of possible value


statistics--field of analysis,interpretationa nd  presenatttion of data--
population --universal set 
sample - subset of universe with all parameters

Sampling - study the part of population 

sampling 
1 probablity 
2 non probablity sampling 


probablity sampling --sample choosen with probablity theory
1 random - randomly choosen (any can be choosen)
2 systematic sampling --every nth record can be choosen (happening in a systemic way )
3 stratified- A stratum is a subset of population 	that shares at least a common chracterstics 
foreg population human ,create a stratum for male and female  and after that choose random samples from the same 


Types of statistics 
1 Descriptive statistics- describe the features of data set by giving the summary  for the same (chracterstics of data)
2 inferential Statistics - makes prediction about data about a  population 


descriptive
measure of central tendency - mean , median, mode
measure of spread(variability) -range ,variance , standard deviation 


mean - sum of all and divide by all
median -sort and choose the middle value . in case of even take the 2 middle values and average them
mode- the most recurrent value is called the mode

range ---> max - min 
inter quartile range -->divide the data in quator
variance --->(=x-mean(x))2/n
sd squareroot of variance 

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

information gain (involved in dt and random forrest) and entropy --->
Entropy -measure the impurity and uncertainty in the data
H(S)=-pi log2(pi)
s= all instances
N= number of distinct 
Pi= event probablity 

Information gain - how much info a particular feature gives us about the final outcome 
Gain(A,S)=H(S)-H(A,S)
H(S)- entropy of whole dataset 
H(A,S)-- entropy of the attribute A 


less the entropy th more imp the variable is 
 ------------------------------------------------probablity and Probablity Distribution------------------------------------
Probablity is ratio of desired outcomes to the total outcome


disjoint event- not common output (a card will be king or queen at a time only one can be drawn)
non disjoint event - common output a student get 100 marks in stat and 100 marks in probablity 

Probablity distribution types
1 probablity density function 
2 normal distribution
3 central limit theorem 


1 probablity density - it is the continous probablity distribution .it is a range between the 2 variable or we can say that probablity of continous random variable lie between range a and b and defined by a bell shaped curve


2 Normal distribution is also called gaussion distribution that denoted the symmetric properties of the mean. which mean data  near the mean occur very frequently than the data occur away the mean . data near the mean represent the entire data set
if the standard deviation is small the curve is Tall and narrow and vice versa

Hypothesis testing- statistians use hypothesis testing whether to check hypothesis is accepted or not  

Ztest t test null hypothesis
