S4x similarity auto taging 
We have legal client in which a 15 min call happens and bpo agents answer questions by entering a string
That string needs to be validate by most of times agent enters same string which reduces the productivity so we implemented a engine fo fiding the similarity of text they enter
We match the string using elmo embeding and finding the similarity and
Find the score if score is less than 60 percent we take string is unique
And agent can enter that string 


After that we devloped a engine which classify the string enter by user into different category that is demonstrated or no demonstrate or partial demonstrate 
Using bert language model
 After the user submission 
There is aaudit team who audit the answers entered by user
Into demonstrate,not demonstrate,partial demonstrate
To find the quality of agents and the  call feedback by user
